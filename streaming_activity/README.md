## 1.Scenario
As a junior developer on, I've been tasked wit analyzing two datasets that track music listening behavior. My role is to help prepare, clean, and explore the data so insights can be shared with the team.

The two datasets are:
* my_streaming_activity.csv - a detailed log of played songs with information such as **SongID**, **Perfomer**, **Album**, **Song**, and timestamps of when each track was played
* Scrobble_Features.csv - a metadata file with Spotify's audio features for many of the songs (e.g. **danceability**, **energy**, **valence**, **tempo**, **popularity**, and **genre**).

## 2.Ask

### **2.1 Business Task**
Understand listening habits, song characteristics, and trends to make better recommendations for future playlists and optimize music discovery.

### **2.2 Main Questions**
* What are the top artists, songs, and albums played most frequently?
* When do you listen to music most (time of day, day of week, seasonal patterns)?
* What audio features define your most played songs (energy, danceability, valence, etc.)?
* Are there notable differences in listening patterns (e.g. weekday vs weekend, morning vs evening)?
* How can we recommend new songs/artists based on existing preference?
