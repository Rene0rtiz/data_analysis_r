## 1.Scenario
A global chocolate company has collected sales data across multiple countries, products, and salespeople. Management wants to understand performance drivers (by country, product, and salesperson), spot seasonality trends, and evaluate efficiency in terms of revenue vs. boxes shipped. The ultimate goal is to increase revenue and improve profitability over the next year.

## 2.Ask
- What countries, products, and salespeople generate the most revenue?
- Are there seasonal patterns in sales that can guide marketing campaigns?
- Which products have high shipping volumes but low revenue per box (potentially lower margin)?
- What actions should the company take to increase revenue by 12% within the next 12 months?
